when we creates the routes, the order of routes are matter.
in the url if you tyoe localhost:3000/about, you still see the response of the / route only , if we keep the / route as in the first place. because after the / everything becomes wild card.if you check /about/123/xyz. you can still see the same response. even though this route does not exist. so keep in mind that, order of the routes are matter, don't keep the / route in the first place.


#installed postman to test our first API

=> we installed the postman, and created a new workspace for the namaste node.
=>create a new collection, then create a http request. hit enter. successfully tested the get request through postman.

=>we can create a different http methods with the same route name. initially we use app.use(). it can handle all the http methods.
=>but if we want to specifically call a method we need to use app.get(),app.post()etc..


#handling multiple route handlers 
=> we can write multiple handler functions with in a single route.
=> but make sure to understand the how the code is executing, we can only send one respond to the client. we can not send multiple responses from multiple handler request.
=>we must have to send the response to the client, if we don't send the response to the client request, it's keep hanging.

##writing middlwares.....
what is middleware?
middleware is just a normalk handler function , which will handle the routes before sending the response to the clients.
=> we talked about the importance of next().
and order of the arguments in the hanler function is also important. if there are 2 arguments(req,res) if there are 3 (req,res,next) if there are 4 (err,req,res,next)
=> ERROR handling
=> we generally handles the errors in try and catch block. in the most cases , we use next(err) in the catch block, and global error handler function will take care about this error. and we must have to passed the err argument in the end handler function, becuase, express check for the err argument in the fucntion, if it sees in any fucntion handling, it may give improper response.
